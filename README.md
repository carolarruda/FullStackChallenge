## Setting Up Repository and Running the App

1. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   - Fork the repository.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git.
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:carolarruda/FullStackChallenge.git
     ```

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
  - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd <reposotory name>
     npm install
     ```


3. **Starting the Server and Frontend:**
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

6. **Accessing the App:**
   - Once both the backend server and frontend are running, you can access the app by opening your web browser and navigating to the specified URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
  
7. **Accessing the Api Specs:**
   - After the server and app is running it's possible to access the api specs here: (`http://localhost:4000/api-docs/`).

8. **Exploring the App:**
   - Log in with the test (username: userTest, password: 1234) credentials or create a new user.
   - Navigate through the app to explore the functionalities such as viewing clients and products, searching, and sorting data.

**Note:** Ensure that the backend server and frontend are both running simultaneously to experience the full functionality of the app.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my code!
